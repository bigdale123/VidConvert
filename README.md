# VidConvert
***
Just point it at a folder containing video files (mp4, mkv, avi), and this will extract any subtitles to srt format and encode them using a preset.

## How to run
Make sure that SubtitleEdit and HandBrakeCLI are both installed, and visible in the path.
Then just `python vid_convert.py <path>`
